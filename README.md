# 99 Problems

My solutions to 99 Problems. This is work in progress and my functional languages playground. Every time I add a new language, I'll try to setup a proper project as well as unit testing.

# Dependencies

- `sbcl`
- `sbt`
- `GNU Make`

# Running the tests

Every solution to a problem is covered by one or more unit tests. In order to run the unit tests you just need to specify one of the following targets: `all`, `lisp` or `scala`.

```
$ make all
$ make lisp
$ make scala
```
